# Hat Shop Token (HatToken)

Hat Shop Token, abbreviated as HatToken (HAT), is an ERC20 token contract implemented in Solidity for managing hat assets in a virtual hat shop. This contract allows users to buy, transfer, and redeem hats using tokens. 

## Features

- **Token Standard**: Implements the ERC20 token standard.
- **Ownership**: Utilizes OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract for ownership management.
- **Token Minting**: Allows the owner to mint new tokens.
- **Hat Management**:
  - Defines hat types with unique IDs and prices.
  - Enables users to redeem hats by paying their prices in tokens.
- **Hat Transfers**: Allows users to transfer hats to other addresses.
- **Administrative Functions**:
  - Addition, update, and removal of hat types and their prices.
- **Utility Functions**: Provides helper functions for string manipulation and integer to string conversion.

## Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Solidity compiler (version ^0.8.20).
   - Truffle or Remix IDE for deployment and testing.

2. **Installation**:
   - Clone the repository.
   - Install required dependencies: 
     ```
     npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
     ```

3. **Deployment**:
   - Compile and deploy the contract using Truffle or Remix.

## Usage

1. **Minting Tokens**:
   - Use the `mint` function to mint new tokens.

2. **Hat Operations**:
   - Redeem hats using the `redeemHat` function.
   - Transfer hats to other addresses using the `transferHat` function.

3. **Administrative Functions**:
   - Add new hat types with prices using `addHatItem`.
   - Update existing hat prices using `updateHatItem`.
   - Remove hat types using `removeHatItem`.

4. **View Functions**:
   - Check the available hat items and their prices with `showHatItems`.
   - View your token balance with `getBalance`.
   - View your hat collection with `getHatCollection`.

## Development

- **Testing**: 
  - Write unit tests using Truffle or another testing framework.
  - Test different functionalities and edge cases.

- **Security Considerations**:
  - Ensure proper access control in administrative functions.
  - Use secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities like reentrancy and integer overflow.
